We want to replicate two figures in a paper : here we will try to replicate the figure 2.A and the figure 3.B in the paper : 'Friendship and Mobility : User Movement In Location-Based Social Networks' published by : Eujoon Cho, Seth A. Myers, Jure Leskovec

## Files :
`replication3B.ipnyb` : file used to run replication of figure 3B and visualize results .  
`replication2A.ipnyb` : file used to run replication of figure 2A and visualize results .  
`process_functions.py` : This class contains utiliy functions to preprocess and process data. 
`visualisation_functions.py` : functions used to have a nice curve in the end.

## General informations : 
- As the data we studied was heavy, good computational power is recommended to run the notebook.  
- In my case, I runned the replication3B with google colab
